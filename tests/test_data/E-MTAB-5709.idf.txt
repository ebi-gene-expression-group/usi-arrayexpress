Investigation Title	RNA-seq of hypoxic and normoxic soybean roots (cultivars: Embrapa 45 and BR 4)			
Comment[Submitted Name]	RNA-seq of hypoxic and normoxic soybean roots (cultivars: Embrapa 45 and BR 4)
Experiment Description	RNA-sequencing of twelve treatments: two cultivars (Embrapa 45 and BR 4), two oxygen conditions [fully aerobic state (normoxy) and hypoxic], and three treatment sampling times (0.5h, 4h, and 28h). For each of twelve treatments, equimolar quantities of purified total RNA from roots of twelve plants [three biological replicates (four plantlets per replicate)] were pooled to result one library. After processing the twelve libraries (poly-A purification, fractionation, cDNA synthesis using random primers, and ligation to bar-coded adapters), fragments of 150250 pb were isolated and multiplexed, resulting one sequencing library (a pooled of equimolar quantities from twelve initial libraries; each library with a specific barcode for further bioinformatic discrimination). Sequencing library was used to produce clusters for a 1 x 100 bp single end-sequencing run into one lane on a flow cell for sequencing in a Hi-Seq 2000 (Illumina).

Protocol Description	Soybean seeds from cultivar BR 4 were germinated on moist filter paper and maintained in a growth chamber at 25  1C and approximately 90% relative humidity. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse using a hydroponic system. Plantlets were transferred to polystyrene supports, which were placed on blue plastic boxes (59 cm  38 cm  16 cm) containing 36 L of Hoagland solution (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950). Plantlets were grown under natural daylight at 27  3C (day) and 24  2C (night), with humidity at 64  9 (day) to 71  5% (night) until the V1 stage (Fehr et al., 1971). The nutrient solution was kept at pH 6.6 and constantly aerated with atmospheric air. Plantlets were placed in a randomized block design comprising two oxygen conditions and three treatment sampling times, each with three biological replicates (four plantlets per replicate).  At the V1 stage, the plantlets were randomly divided into two groups: plants under normoxia (the control condition with plantlets under constant atmospheric aeration) and plantlets under hypoxia (the nutrient solution was constantly bubbled with nitrogen gas). The oxygen concentration was determined before the start of the experiment. The boxes were sealed to avoid the reoxygenation of the nutrient solutions. The oxygen dissolved in the nutrient solution was measured using a portable oxymeter (HI 9146, Hanna). Normoxic conditions contained oxygen concentrations between 7.1 mg/L and 7.8 mg/L, whereas for the hypoxic group, the oxygen concentration was between 0.1 mg/L and 0.3 mg/L (Figure S1). Plantlets were maintained under normoxic (control plants) or hypoxic conditions for 0.5 h, 4 h, and 28 h. At each time point, root tissues were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at 80C.

Total RNA was extracted from root tissues using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer instructions. RNA concentration and purity were measured using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, ND-1000), and the integrity of the molecules was analyzed on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. For each of twelve treatments {two cultivars (Embrapa 45 and BR 4), two oxygen conditions [fully aerobic state (normoxy) and hypoxic], and three treatment sampling times (0.5h, 4h, and 28h), each with three biological replicates (four plantlets per replicate)}, equimolar quantities of purified total RNA from roots of twelve plants were pooled to result one library. The twelve libraries were sent to Fasteris SA (Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland) for processing and sequencing. Libraries were prepared according to standard Illumina protocols and deep sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. After processing the twelve libraries (poly-A purification, fractionation, cDNA synthesis using random primers, and ligation to bar-coded adapters), fragments of 150250 pb were isolated and multiplexed, resulting one sequencing library (a pooled of equimolar quantities from twelve initial libraries; each library with a specific barcode for further bioinformatic discrimination). Then, sequencing library was used to produce clusters for a 1 x 100 bp single end-sequencing run into one lane on a flow cell for sequencing in a Hi-Seq 2000 (Illumina). The raw data was uploaded to the GeneSifter database (Geospiza, Seattle, WA) for alignment with the soybean reference genome (assembly Glyma 1.1) (Schmutz et al., 2010). The mapping of reads and transcripts analysis was done as described previously (Rodrigues et al., 2015).  Rodrigues, F. A., Fuganti-Pagliarini, R., Marcolino-Gomes, J., Nakayama, T. J., Molinari, H.

Sequencing was performed in single end mode with a read length of 100 bp on a Illumina HiSeq 2000.	For each time point (0.5, 4, and 28h), the expression ratio (fold-change, fc) of genes was performed by dividing transcript abundance values (in RPM = Reads per Mapped Million) from plants under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. The statistical significance of DEGs were obtained by using Bioconductor package edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010), corrected by Benjamini and Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We only considered as DEGs those showing fold-change  2 (up),  -2(down), adj. p-value  0.01, and with more than 20 mapped reads (RPM  9) in at least one of the two compared libraries.
