Protocol Description	Whole seedlings were picked up from the medium, untreated or treated with 200 mM NaCl for 4h, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.	Arabidopsis thaliana wild type plants were grown on germination medium (GM; Murashige & Skoog salts, Gamborg's B5 vitamins, 3% sucrose, 0.05% MES-KOH, pH5.7) agar plates at 22C under a day/night photo regime with a 16-h photoperiod at a photon flux density of 40 umol m-2 s-1.	Total RNAs were isolated from frozen samples using the RNAiso Plus Reagent (Takara, Japan) according to the manufacturers protocol. Five to six seedlings were pooled to prepare an RNA sample.	Total RNA (200 ng) was labeled with a Low RNA Input Linear Amplification/Labeling Kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	For each experiment, in which wild type and the srk2abgh quadruple mutant were compared, two sets of microarrays were analyzed using a Cy3 and Cy5 dye swap.	Microarray slides were scanned (scanner model G2505C with scan control software, version A.8.4; Agilent Technologies) and the data were analyzed using Feature Extraction software, version 11.5.1.1 (Agilent technologies) using the default settings.
