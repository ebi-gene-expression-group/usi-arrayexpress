Investigation Title	Herbal formula YYJD induces lung cancer cell apoptosis via activation of EGR1 (RNA-seq)			
Experiment Description	In this study,we demonstrated the transcription factor EGR1 is activated by TCM YYJD and such activation mediated YYJD-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells and provided a novel insight to understand the anti-tumor mechanism of Chinese herb YYJD.

Protocol Description	A549 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 100 units per ml penicillin–streptomycin solution at 37℃, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator, then treated with anti-tumor drug YYJD. 	Total RNA of untreated A549 and treated A549  were extracted using TRIzol regent (Ambio) according to the Ambion standard RNA isolation procedure, and resuspend in RNase free water. 	Approximately 1ug Total RNA was purified using the NEBNext Poly (A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (E7490, NEB). Libraries were constructed using the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7420, NEB). 	Libraries concentration and size were detected by Qubit and Agilent 2100, and then sequenced by Illumina NextSeq 500 following the manufacturer's protocols.
