Experiment Description	The AML cell line KG1a does not express the nucleolar protein NO66. We generated a stable cell line overexpressing NO66 and want to look for differential expression of genes.

Protocol Description	Samples were Cy3 labelled according to Illumina protocol	Control cells (KG1a)  were cultured In DMEM with 10% FKS and transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-NO66. After selection with 100 micro-g/ml G418 the stable sample cell line was generated (KG1a66).	Hybridized to human HT12-v4 beadchip according to manufacturers protocol	TriZol extraction according to the manufactors protocol Thermo Fisher Scientific	quantile normalized (enforces the individual hybridizations to have equal intensity distributions) across all hybridizations
