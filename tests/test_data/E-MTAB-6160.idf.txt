Experiment Description	We have discovered that neutrophils that infiltrate the spinal cord of mice with EAE, a model of multiple sclerosis, but not intravascular neutrophils that crawl on the luminal endothelial surface, bear on their surface the adhesion molecule Icam1. The goal of this experiment was to use Icam1 to isolate these two neutrophil subpopulations in order to compare their transcriptomes and gain insights into their properties. To this end, EAE was induced in C57BL/6J mice by immunization with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide (a.a. 35-55) and adjuvants (i.e. complete Freund’s adjuvant and pertussis toxin). On day 15 post-immunization, intravascular neutrophils (CD45hiCD11b+CD11c−Ly6g+Icam1−) and extravasated neutrophils (CD45hiCD11b+CD11c−Ly6g+Icam1+) were isolated from spinal cords by FACS. For comparison, we simultaneously isolated two other populations of myeloid cells: macrophages (CD45hiCD11b+CD11c−Ly6g−) and dendritic cells (CD45hiCD11b+CD11c+Ly6g−). RNA was analyzed in biological duplicate using Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST arrays.

Protocol Description	RNA (75 ng) was used to produce biotinylated single-strand cDNAs using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Plus Reagent Kit.	Data were processed using the RMA algorithm in Affymetrix Expression Console.	Total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen).	Cells were isolated by FACS from the spinal cord of mice at day 15 post-EAE induction. EAE was induced by injecting mice subcutaneously into both flanks with a total of 200 µl of emulsion containing 300 µg of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 (Synpeptide) dissolved in saline and mixed with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant containing 500 µg of killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37 RA (Difco Laboratories). Mice were also intraperitoneally injected with 20 µg/kg of pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories) immediately and 2 days after immunization.	Arrays were washed and stained using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450, then read using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.	cDNAs were hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 2.0 ST arrays for 16 h at 45°C with constant rotation at 60 rpm.
